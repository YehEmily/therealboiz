<p><span style="font-size:12pt">"<i>I thought of making myself a beautiful wooden Marionette. It must be wonderful, one that will be able to dance, fence, and turn somersaults. With it I intend to go around the world, to earn my crust of bread and cup of wine. What do you think of it?"</i> &mdash; <i>Geppetto, The Adventures of Pinocchio</i></span>

<br/><br/>Puppetry is an ancient art form, originating over 3000 years ago. Since then, it has developed into a complex and intricate form of entertainment. A significant amount of skill and expertise is required to manipulate multiple puppets at once. In today's world of technology, automated puppet shows are still a relatively new concept because they're so difficult to implement; from mechanical design to programming motion, there are a lot of factors to consider. For this project, <b>our goal is to create an automated puppet show capable of making self-adjustments to keep the audience engaged and entertained.</b>
