<p><span style="font-size:12pt">"<i>I thought of making myself a beautiful wooden Marionette. It must be wonderful, one that will be able to dance, fence, and turn somersaults. With it I intend to go around the world, to earn my crust of bread and cup of wine. What do you think of it?"</i> &mdash; <i>Geppetto, The Adventures of Pinocchio</i></span>

<br/><br/>Puppetry is an ancient art form, originating over 3000 years ago. Since then, it has developed into a complex and intricate form of entertainment. A significant amount of skill and expertise is required to manipulate multiple puppets at once. In today's world of technology, automated puppet shows are still a relatively new concept because they're so difficult to implement; from mechanical design to programming motion, there are a lot of factors to consider. For this project, <b>our goal is to create an automated puppet show capable of making self-adjustments to keep the audience engaged and entertained.</b>

<br/><br/>
Our goal is to create a marionette with preprogrammed movements as functions so that we may call each function in a sequence to create shows. In this way, our marionette can adapt to different shows and stories. Since we may be presenting this project at Olin's exposition, we would also like to integrate lighting into our stage so that the show is easier to see. Additionally, our system may use sensor input to detect the presence and proximity of the audience, adjusting the show accordingly.

<br/><br/>
One of the greater challenges we foresee in this endeavor is learning how to control marionettes indirectly. Designing these movements represents a challenge in itself, and we anticipate additional obstacles in keeping all the strings untangled. One of our goals is to have the audience be able interact with the marionettes via sensors, which may require specific calibration methods.
