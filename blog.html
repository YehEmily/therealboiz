<p>Having just completed our first sprint in thie project, we came away with some great ideas for improvement in our next sprint. In terms of how our team works, we want to break the mechanical systems into smaller components to allow for faster testing, and to give the E:Cs something more tangible to do. In terms of our final deliverable, we want to test out using lever arms, consider a systems for drawing the curtains, and test out motors. This is our to-do list for this sprint:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Track</th> <th>Curtains</th> <th>Motors</th></tr>
<tr><td><ul>
	<li>Integrate a track with rest of stage</li>
	<li>Consider different types of tracks</li>
</ul></td>
<td><ul>
	<li>Test sensors</li>
	<li>Consider using sensors to detect applause</li>
	<li>Plan and build structure for mounting sensors and motors</li>
</ul></td>
<td><ul>
	<li>Make a prototype of lever arms</li>
	<li>Test servo motors</li>
	<li>Consider using spools vs. levers</li>
	<li>Decide on what type of motor to use (DC vs. stepper)</li>
	<li>Purchase motors</li>
	<li>Test sensors</li>
	<li>Consider using sensors to detect applause</li>
	</ul></td></tr></table>

<p>During this sprint, we focused mainly on sketch models of both the marionette and the stage. We purchased a marionette from Amazon ($10.58), which we experimented with in order to build our own sketch model of a marionette. We also built a sketch model of the stage. In the way of non-sketch model work, we have begun designing the mechanism by which we will spool strings in order to move the marionette. Finally, we've started considering how we will pull back the curtains on the stage when an audience is detected.
